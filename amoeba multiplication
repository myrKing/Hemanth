The environmental eco club  have discovered a new Amoeba that grows in the order of a Fibonacci series every month. They are exhibiting their amoeba in a national conference. They want to know the size of the amoeba at a particular time instant. If a particular month’s index is given can you write a  program that displays the amoeba’s size……???
//Use Dynamic Programming Strategy
Note: The size of the amoeba on month 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6,7 ..will be 0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8 respectively.
[All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest to output]
Sample input and Output 1:
Enter the number of Months :
7
The amoeba size is 8
Sample input and Output 2:
Enter the number of Months :
12
The amoeba size is 89
code:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Amoeba
{
    public static void main(String[] args)
    {
       Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
       System.out.println("Enter the number of months:");
       int m=sc.nextInt();
       int n[]={0,1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21,34,55,89};
       System.out.println("The amoeba size is "+n[m-1]);
    }
}
