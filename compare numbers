        int a=sc.nextInt();
        int b=sc.nextInt();
        if(a==b){
            System.out.printf("%d is equal to %d",a,b);
        }
         if(a>b){
            System.out.printf("%d is greater than %d",a,b);
        }
         if(a<b){
            System.out.printf("%d is less than %d",a,b);
