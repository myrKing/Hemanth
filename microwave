A microwave oven manufacturer recommends that when heating two items, add 50% to the heating time, and when heating three items double the heating time. Heating more than three items at once is not recommended. Write a program that asks the user for the number of items and the single-item heating time. The program then writes out the recommended heating time.

Input Format:
The first input is an integer which corresponds to the number of items. The second integer is a float which corresponds to the single item heating time.

Output Format:
Refer sample input and output for further formatting specifications.
Note:All text in bold corresponds to input and the rest corresponds to output
Sample Input and Output 1:
Enter the number of items
2
Enter the single item heating time
5.0
The recommended heating time is 7.50
 Sample Input and Output 2:
Enter the number of items
4
Enter the single item heating time
5.0
Number of items is more
code:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Microwave
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc= new Scanner(System.in);
        System.out.println("Enter the number of items");
        int a= sc.nextInt();
        System.out.println("Enter the single item heating time");
        float b= sc.nextFloat();
        float c=(b/2)+b;
        float d=b+b;
        if(a==1) {
            System.out.printf("The recommended heating time is %.2f",b);
        }
        else if(a==2) {
            System.out.printf("The recommended heating time is %.2f",c);
        }
        else if(a==3) {
             System.out.printf("The recommended heating time is %.2f",d);
        }
        else {
            System.out.println("Number of items is more");
        }
    }
}
