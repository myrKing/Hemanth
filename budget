Visual Sensors
Rs. 230.90
Auditory Sensors
Rs. 190.55
Arms
Rs. 125.30
Legs
Rs. 180.90
Can you write a program to do the given task?
Input:
The input consists of 5 positive integers separated by a space (A B C D E).
A: number of blast rifles needed
B: number of visual sensors needed
C: number of auditory sensors needed
D: number of arms needed
E: number of legs needed
Output:
Output consists of a single string (“yes” or “no”). Print yes if the total cost of replacing damaged battle droids is within the sanctioned budget of Rs. 15000. Print no otherwise.

Sample Input:
20 10 14 3 9
Sample Output:
yes
code:
import java.util.Scanner;
public class Budget
{
    public static void main(String args[])
    {
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int A=sc.nextInt();
        int B=sc.nextInt();
        int C=sc.nextInt();
        int D=sc.nextInt();
        int E=sc.nextInt();
        double T=A*350.34+B*230.90+C*190.55+D*125.30+E*180.90;
        if(T<15000){
            System.out.println("yes");
        }
        else
        System.out.println("no");
    }
